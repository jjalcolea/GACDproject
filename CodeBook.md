Code book for the "tidyDataSet"" dataset
=========================================
All the data is in the file **tidyDataSet.txt**

Proccessing
------------
These are the transformations that the R script applies to the raw data to create the tidyDataSet (not neccesarily in the order listed). For details, check the R source code in the **run_analysis.R** file:

### 1. Gather all observations in a single structure
The "test" dataset has been appended at the end of the "train" dataset, in order to recover the full set of observations. Both datasets have
exactly the same structure, so no special transformations are needed to accomplish this.

### 2. Remove the parentheses from the column names
Most of the variable (column) names  in the raw dataset contain a parentheses "()". This may lead to misinterpretation when interwoved with code, and even be problematic, so all the parentheses have been removed from the column (variable) names.

### 3. Remove all the variables (columns) **not** containing the words "mean"" or "std" in their names.
One of the project requirements is to *"extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement"*. **I have assumed that the variables containing the words "mean" or "std" are the ones required**, so every other variable has been removed.

### 4. Enrich the dataset with additional data about the subjects and the activity
This includes two things:  
1. Add a new variable (column) to identify whose subject the measure is from  
2. Add a new variable (column) with the textual description of the activity that the subject was doing when the measure was taken

### 5. Generate the required summarized version of the dataset
This is done in two steps:  
1. Generate a new dataset grouping the original observations by subject and activity and applying the "mean" function as the aggregation operation on every numeric variable  
2. Change the names of the resulting variables, appending the string ".Averaged" at the end of their names, to prevent confusion with the original, detailed measurements.


Dataset structure
------------------
### File structure
The file generated by the R script (**tidyDataSet.txt**) is a plain text file that has the following structure:  
- comma (",") as the separator character among columns
- one observation per line
- the 1st line contains the column (variable) names  

### Variables
These are the variables:  

#### Contextual variables

1   activity.id: Unique identifier of the activity  
2	activity.description: Textual description of the activity  
3	subject.number:  Unique number that identifies a single subject

#### Numeric measurements
All the following variables are numeric. They are the result of averaging the original measures contained in the raw data set by activity and subject. To identify the original variable each one was derived from, remove the ".Averaged" from the name and you will get the original name of the observation.
